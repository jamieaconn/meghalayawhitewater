The lower section of the Kynshi from Wahblei bridge to Ranikor has some of the finest whitewater in Meghalaya with many challenging rapids in a stunning gorge and a 15 meter waterfall at the crux.



It's possible to extend the Kynshi by starting on one of its tributaries. Here Val Biere'nard runs the slide on the Upper Wahblei.
