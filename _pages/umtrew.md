On the banks of the Umtrew, just below the Stage 2 powerhouse, slalom kayaker Ian Vincent has built a homestay, the Shillong Whitewater Village.

Here, he teaches locals to paddle on the section below his house. He has opened it up to tourists to come and stay with his lovely family.  

Home to the first ever Meghalaya Whitewater Festival.
