## BEFORE YOU FLY
Buy comprehensive travel insurance that covers the
activities you plan to do.

## How do I get to Meghalaya?
The easiest way is to take an internal flight to Guwahati. A taxi from Guwahati airport to Shillong (the capital of Meghalaya) takes roughly 3 hours.

## When to go
Monsoon generally comes in June or July and then rivers will be extremely high. Generally August to October is the best time to visit. Towards the end of November levels will be low.

## Visas and Permits
The visa process to India varies from country to country but are generally organised through a company called VFS global.
Most of the process is done online.

## MEGHALAYA RIVER TRANSPORT
* The best way to get around Meghalaya is by sumo (jeep) which have space for 7 including the driver.
* Hire local drivers that know the area.
* Go over your complete schedule with your local
transport team.
* Prior to the trip, discuss possible evacuation points along the river with your transport team. Make sure that you discuss areas/names for places along the way for extraction from predefined evacuation points with your transport team.
* Make sure your local transport team are in areas with mobile network throughout the trip to wait for news and progress messages from the river team.
* Ensure that your transport team has the contact details of the local headmen or people in the area, as well as local government administration and hospitals.

## REGISTRATION
On arrival into Shillong, report to the Foreigners
Registration Office located at IGP Point. Apart from it
being a mandatory law for all foreigners to be registered
with the Police, there are several advantages to doing
this. 

 If there is an issue and you end up hitting SOS on a satellite communication device, it will make rescue efforts much smoother. When an SOS is hit, international
rescue agencies will contact their Indian counterparts
located in mainland India who will then contact the State
Police. 

If you are not registered, State agencies and rescue
teams will have a harder time in providing assistance, in a
situation where time is of the essence.

## PREPARATION
* Share your river trip plan with local contacts.
* Familiarise yourself with the mapsâ€”gorges, nearby
villages, possible trails, elevation profiles and jungle
density for bushwhacking.
* Plan out multiple evacuation options prior to your river
trip.
* Carry maps with you on the river and learn to identify
where you are accurately, either digitally or on paper.
* It is important to have at least one satellite communication device with the team with an extra battery or sufficient charge. If in a jam, climbing up to the top of river canyons will sometimes get you mobile signal, although this is not easy on many sections.
* Have shoes with a strong grip.
* Carry food for an extra day or two, water-filtration kits
or tablets, a tarp, extra lights and batteries.
* Always carry a comprehensive first-aid kit and know how to use it.
