		<h3>Registration</h3>
		<p>
			On arrival into Shillong, report to the Foreigners
			Registration Office located at IGP Point. Apart from it
			being a mandatory law for all foreigners to be registered
			with the Police, there are several advantages to doing
			this. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If there is an issue and you end up hitting SOS on a satellite communication device, it will make rescue efforts much smoother. When an SOS is hit, international
			rescue agencies will contact their Indian counterparts
			located in mainland India who will then contact the State
			Police. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>If you are not registered, State agencies and rescue
			teams will have a harder time in providing assistance, in a
			situation where time is of the essence.</b>
		</p>

		<h3>Preparations for river trips</h3>
		<p>Home to countless rivers, Meghalaya is a world-class paddling destination. However, inherent dangers also lie in the aspects that make Meghalaya beautiful. It is remote in  its access, dramatic in geology and has very volatile weather systems.

			<li> 
				Discuss possible evacuation points along the river with your transport team. Make sure that you discuss areas/names for places along the way for extraction from predefined evacuation points with your transport team.

			</li>
			<li>
				Share your river trip plan with local contacts.
			</li>
			<li>
				Familiarise yourself with the mapsâ€”gorges, nearby
				villages, possible trails, elevation profiles and jungle
				density for bushwhacking.
