<p>Hidden away off the beaten path in North East India is the small <b>culturally rich hill state of Meghalaya</b>.</p>

<p>Meghalaya recieves the <b>heaviest rainfall anywhere on earth</b> and all this water creates rivers that are some of the steepest and most powerful on the planet. </p>

<p>Its rivers are <b>steeped in folklore</b> that was shared over campfires and hearths back in a time when its people had no written word. These rivers are the bedrock of folklore and are surrounded by diverse natural beauty.</p>

<p>This <b>wild frontier</b> has recently caught the attention of whitewater paddlers from all over the world.</p>
